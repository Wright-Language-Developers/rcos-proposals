### Description:
Wright Language is a multipurpose programming language and compiler written in
rust using nom, clap, codespan, and a few other libraries. The main goal of this
language is to enable productivity by providing a unique combination of the
Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming paradigms. Wright is mainly
inspired by rust, but also includes aspects of java, scala, and kotlin.
